    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Biryani is a classic Indian dish made with fragrant basmati rice, flavorful spices, and a variety of meats or vegetables. The dish is typically prepared by layering cooked rice with a richly spiced meat or vegetable mixture, often containing ingredients like onions, garlic, ginger, tomatoes, and yogurt. The layers are then steamed together to allow the flavors to meld, resulting in a delicious and aromatic one-pot meal.</p>
    <p>
        To prepare biryani, start by marinating the meat or vegetables in a blend of spices, herbs, and yogurt to enhance the flavor and tenderness. Meanwhile, cook the basmati rice until partially done, then layer it with the meat mixture in a heavy-bottomed pot. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and cook over low heat until the rice is fully cooked and the flavors have infused. The result is a fragrant and flavorful dish that is perfect for special occasions or family gatherings.
