    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of pasta, rich meat or vegetable sauce, creamy b√©chamel or ricotta cheese, and melted mozzarella. The dish is typically assembled by alternating layers of cooked lasagna noodles with a flavorful tomato-based sauce, often containing ground beef, sausage, or vegetables. A blend of cheeses, including Parmesan and mozzarella, adds a creamy and gooey texture. The dish is then baked until golden and bubbly, allowing the flavors to meld together perfectly.</p>
    
    <p>To prepare a delicious homemade lasagna, start by cooking the sauce with onions, garlic, tomatoes, and seasonings like oregano and basil. Meanwhile, boil the lasagna noodles until al dente and prepare a cheese mixture, often combining ricotta, eggs, and Parmesan. In a baking dish, layer the sauce, noodles, and cheese mixture, repeating the process until full. Finally, top with extra cheese and bake until the top is golden brown. Once done, let the lasagna rest before slicing to allow the layers to set, ensuring a perfect, hearty bite every time.</p>

        <li>1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (60ml) red wine</li>    
        <li>12 ounces (340g) ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (180ml) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces (450g) mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup (240ml) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Steps</li>
        <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one-half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
