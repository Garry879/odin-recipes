    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken BBQ is a flavorful and smoky dish made by marinating chicken in a rich blend of spices, sauces, and seasonings before grilling it to perfection. The marinade typically includes ingredients like soy sauce, garlic, paprika, honey, and a hint of lemon juice to enhance the taste and tenderness of the meat. Some recipes also use a barbecue sauce glaze, which caramelizes beautifully over the heat, creating a crispy, slightly charred coating. Whether grilled over an open flame, baked, or cooked on a stovetop, BBQ chicken is a favorite for outdoor gatherings and family meals.

        To prepare BBQ chicken, start by marinating the chicken for at least a few hours, or preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to penetrate deeply. Once marinated, grill the chicken over medium heat, turning occasionally and brushing it with extra barbecue sauce for a smoky and tangy finish. The key to juicy BBQ chicken is cooking it slowly to prevent drying out while ensuring a nice char on the outside. Serve the chicken hot with coleslaw, grilled vegetables, or corn on the cob for a delicious and satisfying meal.
